Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your instructor!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have been studying the codings in baisc waveform and digital audio effects, and I'm now able to write C code to generate triangle waves and square waves as well as plotting out the general waveforms graphicsfor my final projects, I'm also able to write code for digital audio effects such as delay, reverb and bit quantization. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven't done too much with PortMIDI related topics, and this will be my next week's plan for the final projects.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

While I'm reviewing the course material and sample c codes given, I am capable of understand each individual code, but I think I still some more instruction on how to combine each individual parts of the coding together.
